/**
 * A palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backwards and forwards, for example:
 *
 *  "123454321"
 *
 *  "asdfggfdsa"
 *
 * In English palindromes we can ignore uppercase and lowercase, whitespaces and punctuation, as in:
 *
 *  "Madam, I'm Adam"
 *
 *  "Never odd or even"
 *
 *  "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama"
 *
 * In some languages, accents
 *
 * Write a function that can detect if a String is a language palindrome.
 *
 * Extra points if you can come up with both a recursive and non-recursive approach
 *
 * Write a comprehensive set of Unit Tests
 *
