/**
 * Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * A palindrome is a word or sentence that’s spelled the same way both forward and backward, 
 * ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
 *
 * Note. You’ll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) 
 * and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.
 * 

 *
 * Extra points if you can come up with both a recursive and non-recursive approach

 *
 * Write a comprehensive set of Unit Tests
 *
 * Hint: To search for all non-alphanumeric characters:
 * Regex: /[^A-Za-z0–9]/g
